  # Description
  <p>As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their Emails and Github Profiles. The web application uses inquirer.js to query the Manager which allows them to build out their team. Once the query is complete an index.html file is produce allowing the user to open this file in a live server for viewing.</p>

  <p>The web application has several classes to support various employee types. Since the Manager is the individual who interacts with the query the only employee types they can choose from are 'Engineer' and 'Intern.'</p>

  <p>The web application uses Jest to run tests to ensure that the employee classes function as expected.</p>

  # Installation
  <p>In order to run the application clone the repository and open the folder within Visual Studio. Right click index.js and select 'Open in integrated Terminal.' The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js</p>
