  # Description
  <p>As a manager I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to their Emails and Github Profiles. The web application uses inquirer.js to query the Manager which allows them to build out their team. Additionally, the web application uses tests to ensure that the employee classes function as expected.</p>

  # Installation
  <p>In order to run the application, right click index.js and select 'Open in integrated Terminal.' The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js</p>
